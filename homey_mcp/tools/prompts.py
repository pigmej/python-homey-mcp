- **Device Types Available**: {context.device_summary.get("device_type_count", 0)}
- **Capabilities Available**: {context.device_summary.get("capability_count", 0)}

## Device Control Guidance

### Getting Started
1. **List Available Devices**: Use the device listing tools to see all devices in your system
2. **Check Device Status**: Verify device online status before attempting control
3. **Identify Capabilities**: Each device has specific capabilities that determine what actions are possible

### Common Device Types and Control Patterns

#### Lighting Devices
- **Turn On/Off**: Use the `onoff` capability
- **Dimming**: Use the `dim` capability (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Color Control**: Use `light_hue`, `light_saturation`, `light_temperature` capabilities
- **Example**: "Turn on bedroom light to 50% brightness"

#### Climate Control
- **Temperature**: Use `target_temperature` capability
- **Mode Control**: Use `thermostat_mode` capability (heat, cool, auto, off)
- **Example**: "Set living room thermostat to 22Â°C in heating mode"

#### Security Devices
- **Motion Sensors**: Read `alarm_motion` capability
- **Door/Window Sensors**: Read `alarm_contact` capability
- **Cameras**: Use device-specific capabilities for recording/streaming

#### Entertainment Devices
- **Volume Control**: Use `volume_set` capability
- **Power Control**: Use `onoff` capability
- **Input Selection**: Use device-specific input capabilities

### Control Best Practices
1. **Check Device Status First**: Always verify a device is online before sending commands
2. **Use Appropriate Values**: Respect capability value ranges (e.g., 0.0-1.0 for dimming)
3. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Some devices may not respond immediately
4. **Group Similar Actions**: Use zones to control multiple devices efficiently

### Available Device Types in Your System
{", ".join(context.device_summary.get("sample_device_types", [])) if context.device_summary.get("sample_device_types") else "No device types detected"}

### Zone-Based Control
Your system has {context.zone_summary.get("total_count", 0)} zones configured:
{", ".join(context.zone_summary.get("zone_names", [])) if context.zone_summary.get("zone_names") else "No zones configured"}

Use zone-based control to manage multiple devices simultaneously within the same area.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- If a device doesn't respond, check its online status
- Verify the capability exists before using it
- Some devices may have delays in status updates
- Check device-specific documentation for special requirements

## Flow Creation Framework

### Understanding Flow Structure
Every HomeyPro flow consists of three main components:
1. **WHEN** (Trigger) - What starts the flow
2. **AND** (Conditions) - Optional conditions that must be met
3. **THEN** (Actions) - What happens when triggered

### Step 1: Define Your Automation Goal

#### Common Automation Scenarios
- **Security**: "Turn on lights when motion is detected at night"
- **Comfort**: "Adjust temperature when someone arrives home"
- **Energy**: "Turn off devices when no one is home"
- **Convenience**: "Start morning routine at sunrise"
- **Safety**: "Send notification if door is left open"

#### Questions to Ask Yourself
1. What event should trigger this automation?
2. Are there specific conditions when it should/shouldn't run?
3. What actions should happen when triggered?
4. Which devices and zones are involved?

### Step 2: Choose Your Trigger (WHEN)

#### **Time-Based Triggers**
- **Specific Time**: "At 7:00 AM on weekdays"
- **Sunrise/Sunset**: "30 minutes before sunset"
- **Interval**: "Every 15 minutes"

#### **Device-Based Triggers**
- **Motion Detection**: "When motion is detected in [zone]"
- **Door/Window**: "When front door opens"
- **Temperature**: "When temperature drops below 18Â°C"
- **Power Usage**: "When device power consumption changes"

#### **System-Based Triggers**
- **Presence**: "When someone arrives/leaves home"
- **Weather**: "When it starts raining"
- **App Events**: "When specific app condition is met"

#### **Manual Triggers**
- **Button Press**: "When physical button is pressed"
- **Voice Command**: "When voice command is spoken"
- **Mobile App**: "When flow is manually started"

### Step 3: Set Conditions (AND) - Optional but Powerful

#### **Time Conditions**
- "Only between 6 PM and 11 PM"
- "Only on weekdays"
- "Not during vacation mode"

#### **Device State Conditions**
- "Only if living room lights are off"
- "Only if no one is home"
- "Only if outdoor temperature is below 15Â°C"

#### **Logic Conditions**
- "AND all conditions must be true"
- "OR any condition can be true"
- "NOT condition must be false"

### Step 4: Define Actions (THEN)

#### **Device Control Actions**
- **Lighting**: Turn on/off, set brightness, change color
- **Climate**: Adjust temperature, change mode
- **Entertainment**: Play music, adjust volume
- **Security**: Arm/disarm, send notifications

#### **System Actions**
- **Notifications**: Send to phone, email, or other apps
- **Variables**: Set/change system variables
- **Other Flows**: Start or stop other flows
- **Delays**: Wait before next action

{", ".join(f"- {zone}" for zone in context.zone_summary.get("zone_names", [])) if context.zone_summary.get("zone_names") else "- No zones configured"}

Use zones to create location-based automations and control multiple devices in the same area.

#### Device Categories Available
{", ".join(f"- {device_type}" for device_type in context.device_summary.get("sample_device_types", [])) if context.device_summary.get("sample_device_types") else "- No device types detected"}

Consider how different device types can work together in your flows.

### Flow Creation Best Practices

#### **Start Simple**
1. Create basic flows first (single trigger, single action)
2. Test thoroughly before adding complexity
3. Add conditions and multiple actions gradually

#### **Use Descriptive Names**
- Good: "Turn on porch light at sunset"
- Bad: "Light flow 1"

#### **Consider Edge Cases**
- What if the device is offline?
- What if multiple triggers happen quickly?
- How to handle conflicting flows?

#### **Test and Iterate**
1. Enable the flow and monitor its behavior
2. Check flow execution logs for issues
3. Adjust timing, conditions, or actions as needed

### Common Flow Templates

#### **Security Flow Template**
```
WHEN: Motion detected in [zone]
AND: Time is between sunset and sunrise
AND: Security mode is enabled
THEN: Turn on [zone] lights to 100%
THEN: Send notification "Motion detected in [zone]"
THEN: Wait 5 minutes
THEN: Turn off [zone] lights
```

#### **Comfort Flow Template**
```
WHEN: Someone arrives home
AND: Time is after 5 PM
AND: Outdoor temperature is below 20Â°C
THEN: Set living room temperature to 22Â°C

- **Example**: Instead of 3 separate "every hour" flows, create one comprehensive hourly flow

##### **Device-Based Triggers**
- **Reduce Sensitivity**: Adjust motion sensor delays to prevent rapid triggering
- **Group Similar Triggers**: Combine multiple device triggers of the same type
- **Use Zone Logic**: Trigger on zone changes rather than individual devices

##### **System-Based Triggers**
- **Presence Detection**: Use geofencing instead of frequent location checks
- **Weather Triggers**: Use significant weather changes, not minor fluctuations
- **App Integration**: Minimize external API calls by caching data

#### **Condition Optimization**

##### **Simplify Logic Chains**
- **Before**: Multiple nested AND/OR conditions
- **After**: Streamlined condition sets with clear logic
- **Tip**: Use variables to store complex calculations

##### **Device State Checking**
- **Batch Checks**: Check multiple device states in single conditions
- **Cache Results**: Store frequently checked states in variables
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Don't check conditions that triggers already verify

##### **Time-Based Conditions**
- **Use Ranges**: "Between 6 PM and 11 PM" instead of multiple time checks
- **Day Logic**: Use day-of-week conditions efficiently
- **Season/Month**: Consider seasonal variations in automation needs

#### **Action Optimization**

##### **Device Control Actions**
- **Group Commands**: Send multiple commands to same device together
- **Zone Actions**: Control entire zones instead of individual devices
- **Stagger Timing**: Add small delays between high-power device activations

- Floor-based grouping
- Comprehensive coverage
- Professional management

### Device Assignment Guidelines

#### **Device-to-Zone Mapping**

##### **Lighting Devices**
- **Primary Rule**: Assign lights to the zone where they're physically located
- **Exception**: Hallway lights might belong to "Common Areas" zone
- **Consideration**: Outdoor lights should be in appropriate outdoor zones

##### **Climate Control**
- **Thermostats**: Assign to the zone they primarily control
- **Sensors**: Place in the zone where they measure conditions
- **HVAC Units**: Assign to utility zones or the primary area they serve

##### **Security Devices**
- **Door/Window Sensors**: Assign to the zone of the protected opening
- **Motion Sensors**: Place in the zone where motion is detected
- **Cameras**: Assign to the zone they monitor
- **Alarm Panels**: Usually in a central "Security" or "Entry" zone

##### **Entertainment Devices**
- **TVs/Audio**: Assign to the entertainment zone where they're used
- **Streaming Devices**: Same zone as the display they connect to
- **Speakers**: Zone where the audio is heard (may differ from device location)

#### **Multi-Zone Devices**
Some devices affect multiple zones:
- **Central HVAC**: Create a "HVAC System" zone or assign to "Utility"
- **Whole-House Audio**: Consider a "Audio System" zone
- **Security System**: Use a dedicated "Security" zone
- **Network Equipment**: "Utility" or "Technical" zone

### Zone Optimization Strategies

#### **Current System Analysis**
Based on your {total_zones} zones and {total_devices} devices:

{
            f'''
**Optimization Recommendations:**
- Your system appears well-balanced with {avg_devices_per_zone:.1f} devices per zone
- Consider grouping similar device types within zones for easier management
- Review zone names for clarity and consistency
'''
            if total_zones > 0 and avg_devices_per_zone <= 10
            else f'''
**Optimization Needed:**
- {"Consider creating zones to organize your devices" if total_zones == 0 else f"Consider redistributing devices - {avg_devices_per_zone:.1f} devices per zone may be too many"}
- Start with basic room-based zones
- Group devices by physical location first
'''
        }

#### **Device Type Distribution**
Your available device types: {
            ", ".join(device_types) if device_types else "None detected"
        }

**Suggested Zone Assignments:**
{
            chr(10).join(
                f"- **{device_type}**: Assign to zones based on physical location and primary usage area"
                for device_type in device_types[:5]
            )
            if device_types
            else "- No device types detected for specific recommendations"
        }

#### **Performance Optimization**
- **Zone Size**: Keep zones manageable (5-15 devices per zone ideal)
- **Logical Grouping**: Group devices that are often controlled together
- **Automation Efficiency**: Design zones to support your most common automation scenarios
- **Future Growth**: Leave room for additional devices in each zone

### Zone Management Best Practices

#### **Regular Maintenance**
1. **Monthly Review**: Check if device assignments still make sense
2. **Seasonal Adjustments**: Consider seasonal device usage patterns
3. **New Device Integration**: Plan zone assignment before adding devices
4. **Zone Cleanup**: Remove unused or offline devices from zones

#### **Documentation**
- **Zone Purpose**: Document the intended use of each zone
- **Device List**: Maintain a list of devices in each zone
- **Automation Notes**: Record which flows use which zones
- **Change Log**: Track zone modifications and reasons

#### **User Training**
- **Household Members**: Ensure everyone understands the zone structure
- **Naming Consistency**: Use zone names consistently in conversations
- **Voice Commands**: Train voice assistants with zone names
- **Mobile Access**: Show family members how to navigate zones in apps

### Common Zone Organization Mistakes

#### **Over-Complication**
- **Too Many Zones**: Creating zones for every small area
- **Inconsistent Naming**: Using different naming conventions
- **Logical Confusion**: Zones that don't match physical or functional reality

#### **Under-Organization**
- **Too Few Zones**: Putting all devices in one or two zones
- **Mixed Purposes**: Combining unrelated areas in single zones
- **No Structure**: Random device assignments without logic

#### **Maintenance Issues**
- **Outdated Assignments**: Not updating zones when devices move
- **Orphaned Devices**: Devices not assigned to any zone
- **Duplicate Functions**: Multiple zones serving the same purpose

### Zone-Based Automation Examples

#### **Morning Routine by Zone**
```
Flow: Morning Activation
WHEN: 7:00 AM on weekdays
THEN:
- Turn on Kitchen lights to 80%
- Set Living Room temperature to 22Â°C
- Turn on Master Bedroom lights to 30%
- Start Coffee Maker in Kitchen zone
```

#### **Security by Zone**
```
Flow: Evening Security
WHEN: 10:00 PM daily
THEN:
- Turn off all lights in Outdoor zones
- Arm motion sensors in Ground Floor zones
- Set Entry zone to security mode
- Enable night lighting in Hallway zones
```

#### **Energy Saving by Zone**
```
Flow: Away Mode
WHEN: No one home for 30 minutes
THEN:
- Turn off all devices in Living Areas
- Lower temperature in all Bedroom zones
- Keep only essential devices in Utility zones
- Maintain security devices in all zones
```
